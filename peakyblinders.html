        <h1>Review of Peaky Blinders</h1>

      <blockquote><strong>“I’m not God. Not yet.”</strong></blockquote>
      <p>Peaky Blinders is one of those rare series that blends cinematic style, magnetic characters, and unrelenting tension into a historical crime drama that often feels mythic. Across six gripping seasons, it tells the story of Thomas Shelby — a soldier turned gangster turned political power player — whose ambition, trauma, and brilliance both elevate and destroy those around him.<br>
        Created by Steven Knight and set in post-WWI Birmingham, the show begins as a local gang drama but steadily evolves into a grand Shakespearean tragedy. With mesmerizing performances, stylized violence, and poetic writing, Peaky Blinders stands as one of the most captivating TV dramas of the 21st century.</p>
      <h2>Setting & Atmosphere</h2>
      <p>From the start, Peaky Blinders establishes a world drenched in grime, smoke, and tension. The streets of Small Heath are not just muddy backdrops — they’re haunted by history. The trauma of WWI is baked into the show’s DNA. Men drink, smoke, and kill to forget what they saw in the trenches.<br>
        This world is brought to life with stunning cinematography and a modern soundtrack (featuring artists like Nick Cave, PJ Harvey, and Radiohead) that somehow works, even when anachronistic. It gives the show its edge, turning gang wars into poetic operas of power and pain.</p>
      <h2>Story and Structure</h2>
      <p>Set in post-WWI England, Peaky Blinders begins with the return of Tommy Shelby and his brothers from the trenches. Haunted by the war, Tommy builds the Peaky Blinders into a formidable criminal enterprise. He begins by fixing horse races and collecting protection money, but soon he’s brushing shoulders with aristocrats, communists, the IRA, Russian exiles, and eventually fascists.<br>
        The early seasons center on Tommy’s consolidation of power and his attempts to legitimize the family business. But as he gains more influence — even entering politics — his soul deteriorates. His brother Arthur becomes increasingly unstable, his cousin Michael turns traitor, and his beloved Polly becomes alienated. The most devastating blow comes in Season 3 with the assassination of his wife, Grace, which shatters Tommy’s last grip on peace and turns him colder than ever.<br>
        By the final season, Tommy is an elected MP and publicly respectable — but entirely hollow. After the death of his daughter Ruby and learning he’s supposedly terminally ill, he plans to end his life. But in a final twist, he uncovers the diagnosis was a lie orchestrated by Oswald Mosley and his fascist allies. He walks away from his old life, quite literally burning down his house — not redeemed, but no longer trapped.</p>
      <h2>Characters and Performances</h2>
      <p>Cillian Murphy delivers a career-defining performance as Tommy Shelby — cold, calculating, and magnetic. Tommy is a war-scarred genius who manipulates everyone, including himself, in pursuit of a future he never gets to enjoy. Murphy’s minimalist acting — his silences, his glances — says more than words ever could.<br>
        Helen McCrory’s Polly Gray is the matriarch and spiritual anchor of the Shelby family. Fierce, wise, and emotionally intricate, Polly’s death offscreen (due to McCrory’s passing) left a gaping hole in the final season that no character could fill.<br>
        Paul Anderson’s Arthur Shelby is all explosive emotion, a man wrecked by war and always on the edge. Sophie Rundle (Ada), Finn Cole (Michael), Anya Taylor-Joy (Gina), and Tom Hardy (Alfie Solomons) all contribute standout performances that deepen the world and the inner web of betrayals.</p>
      <h2>Themes</h2>
      <p>At its core, Peaky Blinders is about war — not just the physical kind, but psychological warfare. Every Shelby brother is a casualty of World War I, and the show never lets you forget that the gang’s empire is built on blood-soaked trauma. The show also examines legacy, class conflict, imperialism, and the slow creep of fascism — especially in its later seasons with Oswald Mosley.<br>
        The recurring motif of death — Tommy’s hallucinations, Arthur’s breakdowns, Grace’s ghost — makes clear that power can’t buy peace. For Tommy, empire is a cage. By the end, the only way out is self-erasure.</p>
      <h2>Cinematography and Soundtrack</h2>
      <p>Few series blend historical realism with such stylized intensity. The show's use of modern rock and blues (Nick Cave, Arctic Monkeys, PJ Harvey) over 1920s settings shouldn’t work — but it does. The visual language is just as bold: slow-motion shots, dreamlike montages, and tightly framed confrontations make every episode feel like cinema.</p>
      <h2>Weaknesses</h2>
      <p>The show stumbles at times under the weight of its ambition. Later seasons (especially 5 and 6) get bogged down in political subplots and underdeveloped characters like Finn and Gina. Michael’s arc feels forced by the end, and the absence of Polly in Season 6 is felt in every scene.<br>
        Still, these flaws are minor compared to the scale and power of what Peaky Blinders accomplishes.</p>
      <h2>Final Verdict</h2>
      <p>Peaky Blinders is not just a stylish crime saga — it’s a meditation on power, family, and the curse of survival. Tommy Shelby is as iconic as Walter White or Tony Soprano — but more tragic. His war never ended. His mind was the battlefield.
        Even with its rough edges, Peaky Blinders ends not with a bang, but with a man walking into the unknown — having burned down everything behind him.</p>
